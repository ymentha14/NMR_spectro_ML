### Dataset
The  dataset is divided into a training and a testing set composed of 250’000 and 568’238 samples respectively and both having 30 features. The training set is paired with labels where each sample is associated  to  a  category  (−1 for  background  noise  and 1 for the presence of a Higgs Boson).

### Code architecture
The code is separated into 3 distinct files:

>1. run.py
>2. implementations.py
>3. proj1_helpers.py

The `run.py` file contains the main and can be run in a terminal. All useful functions are implemented in the `implementations.py` file.
